# Wrangling-Analyzing-Data

This data set contains 1,157 baseball players data including their handedness (right or left handed or both hands), height (in inches), weight (in pounds), batting average, and home runs

 I used various visualizations methods in this exploration to find out interesting patterns and relationships between variables in this dataset e.g of variables in Dataset: handedness, home runs, height, weight and batting average These were the most interesting variables to find relations between them as they help to understand the nature of baseball sport and how well performing players got recognized for. 


 Some of the used visualization methods: line plot, horizontal bar plot, area chart, scatterplot they’re all used in some way to be able to figure out the most of hidden patterns in the data by the help of some analytical tools like line trend that was used with some line plots and also the hover interactions were used in all of visualizations to make the reader able to read any piece of information from the graphs. These types of plots and tools are used because they’re the most appropriate things to easily read information from the graphs and also they’re appropriate for the variables and relations that we have in the dataset.
